Goal: Upgrade Finance Hub to be owner-first “financial story” UX without changing theme/colors.
Repo context: Expo (desktop/web). Do NOT change design tokens. Only restructure layouts and add components.

1) Books page redesign (app/finance-hub/books.tsx)
- Keep routing + tabs, but change presentation:
  A) Rename labels in UI (not routes):
     - “Money Shelves” (Chart of Accounts)
     - “Money Moves” (Journal Entries)
     - “Money Trail” (General Ledger)
  B) Add an “Accountant view” toggle (persist in localStorage / zustand):
     - Owner view: cards + guided flows + timeline
     - Accountant view: existing tables/forms (debits/credits visible)

2) Money Shelves (COA)
- Replace accounts table-first layout with:
  - Department tiles (Assets/Liabilities/Income/Expenses/Equity)
  - Inside each: shelf cards (account cards) with balance, trend, last activity.
- Keep existing data fetch from /api/quickbooks/accounts.
- Add “Explain” drawer per department total: list top contributing accounts.

3) Money Moves (Journal)
- Owner flow:
  - A guided wizard (“What happened?”) that generates JE lines behind the scenes.
  - Only show debit/credit lines in Accountant view (reuse current form).
- Keep POST endpoint behavior unchanged; wrap it.

4) Money Trail (GL)
- Replace report rows-first layout with a timeline grouping (day/week/month).
- Each timeline item expands to show:
  - Source (QB report row)
  - Links to related objects (if available)
  - “Explain” list of contributing rows

5) Storyline foundation (new)
- Add a normalized client model for finance events (local-only first):
  - type, time, amount, direction, counterparty, provider, source ids, links.
- Use it to render the new timeline views.
- Later we’ll back it with a real finance_event table, but implement the UI contract now.

6) Booking page (app/bookings/index.tsx)
- Add a “Booking → Money” panel:
  - Paid vs unpaid, next payout date, reconciled %, drill links to invoices/payouts/books.
- Placeholder data allowed, but UI must support drill + explain hooks.

Deliverables:
- New components: components/finance/story/* (cards, timeline, explain drawer, wizard)
- Updated books.tsx + bookings/index.tsx
- No theme changes. No new dependencies unless absolutely required.
