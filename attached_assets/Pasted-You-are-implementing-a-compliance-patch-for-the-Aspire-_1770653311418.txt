You are implementing a compliance patch for the Aspire Expo Router web/desktop app to satisfy Plaid production questionnaire requirements.

Repository context:
- Project: Aspire-Desktop-lite (Expo Router)
- Domain: https://www.aspireos.app
- Plaid is already connected in Sandbox; do not break sandbox testing.

Goal:
Implement the files in the attached patch folder into the project, wire the screens into the existing navigation, and enforce pre-Plaid-Link gating:
1) Add in-app legal pages:
   - app/more/privacy-policy.tsx
   - app/more/terms.tsx
   - app/more/data-retention.tsx
   - app/more/plaid-consent.tsx
   - update app/more/policies.tsx to include links to these pages

2) Implement missing security libs required by the existing MFA screens:
   - lib/security/mfa.ts
   - lib/security/storage.ts
   - lib/security/plaidConsent.ts

3) Wire gating into Plaid connect flow:
   - Before calling Plaid Link / creating link_token, require:
     (a) Plaid consent record exists (plaid-consent screen)
     (b) MFA is enabled AND recently verified (mfa-setup + mfa-verify screens)
   - If not satisfied, route user to:
     - /more/plaid-consent
     - /more/mfa-setup then /more/mfa-verify
   - Sandbox must still work after user completes consent + MFA.

4) Dependencies:
   - Add and install: otplib, qrcode
   - If using secure storage: expo-secure-store (or implement a safe web fallback)

5) Domain publishing:
   - Ensure privacy/terms/retention pages are reachable on web build routes so we can provide links in Plaid questionnaire:
     https://www.aspireos.app/privacy
     https://www.aspireos.app/terms
     https://www.aspireos.app/data-retention
   - If routing requires different paths, implement redirects or align route paths.

Deliverables:
- PR-style change summary
- Confirmation of routes and gating behavior
- Screenshots of: Policies hub, Privacy page, Consent page, MFA setup/verify, and Plaid connect blocked until gates satisfied
